<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a front-end implementation of a restaurant website. It is a complete front-end site with four pages: The landing page, the login page, a menu page and reservations page. <br>
Each page's UI and code was carried out by an individual group member.<br>
The significance of this project is:
<ol>
<li>It gives the restaurant a digital brand image, which is important in this digital age</li>
<li> Increase market reach by appealing to the new customer frontier, which is the internet 
</li>
<li>Create customer trust, by giving the customer first-hand information regarding the restaurant rather than relying on third-party websites for information. Things like menu updates, chef specials wil especially benefit from this</li>
<li>Having a digital footprint is as important a marketing frontier as mainstream media, if not more. Moreover maintaining a website is much cheaper than running advertisement on mainstream media. You can also use google ads to increase your reach.
</li>
<li>A website also provides a platform to provide other services such as reservations, events and other services that can attract users and increase revenue growth.</li>
</ol>
